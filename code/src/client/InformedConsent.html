<div align="center"><h2><b>Preferred Difficulty Levels in Novel Computer-Based Tasks</b></h2></div></p>
<p>
You are invited to participate in a research study, the purpose of which is to help understand the factors contributing to preferred difficulty levels in novel computer-based tasks.  
</p>
<p>
<b>INFORMATION</b>
<br>
To help us in this task, we will ask you to participate in a study which lasts approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) minutes.  You will be asked to complete different types of tasks and to adjust the difficulty level of those tasks to be the most enjoyable for you.  There will be three different types of tasks: visual, verbal, and kinesthetic.
</p>
<p>
For the visual task, you will be asked to picture a circle which goes through all three vertices of a triangle.  You will be asked to compare the sizes of two of these circles.  
</p>
<p>
For the verbal task, you will be asked to decide how many words in a list rhyme with a target word.  You will have three (3) seconds to complete this task.  For instance, if the target word is "our", and the list contains "power", "pour", "grower" and "sour", you would answer by pressing '2' (since "power" and "sour" rhyme with "our", but "pour" and "grower" do not). 
</p>
<p>
For the kinesthetic task, you will be asked to navigate a ball through a maze.  If the ball touches the wall, you start from the beginning again.   
</p>
<p>
For each of these types of tasks, the difficulty level can vary between trials for up to the first fifteen (15) trials.  You will then be asked to set the difficulty level to a constant value for the next up to fifteen (15) trials.  Please choose carefully when doing so, as once you make your choice this value cannot be altered for the following trials. </p>
<p>
A target of 100 participants has been set for this trial.  
</p>
<p>
<b>RISKS</b>
<br>
There are no foreseeable risks associated with this study.  
</p>
<p>
<b>BENEFITS</b>
<br>
The results of this study will help benefit scientific understanding of what people want to experience when interacting with computer-based tasks.  Such information will be beneficial to the design of both educational and recreational video games.  
</p>
<p>
<b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b>
<br>
The data obtained in this study will be treated as confidential and will be stored securely on a server.  You will not be asked to contribute any identifying information.  Your responses will be encrypted before being sent to the server, and no personal information about you or your computer will be sent with your responses.  The program with which you are interacting will not place any cookies on your computer and will not transmit data about the session to any third parties.  Data from your responses will be saved for at least three (3) years after completion of the study.  Data will be destroyed no more than ten (10) years after completion of the study.  
</p>
<p>
<b>COMPENSATION</b>
<br>
You will receive no monetary compensation for participating in this study.  
</p>
<p>
<b>CONTACT</b>
<br>
If you have any questions at any time about the study or its procedures, you may contact the principal investigator, Steven Riley, at 619-757-8799 or at <a href="mailto:NDNUVideoGameStudy@gmail.com?Subject=Question%20About%20Study" target="_top">NDNUVideoGameStudy@gmail.com</a>.  If you feel you have not be treated according to the descriptions in this form, or your rights as a participant have been violated during the course of this study, you may contact the Research Integrity Officer (RIO) at the office of the Provost at NDNU by calling (650) 508-3494.  
</p>
<p>
<b>PARTICIPATION</b>
<br>
Your participation in this study is voluntary.  You may decline to participate and have your data withdrawn at any time before, during or after completing the tasks in this program.  If you decide to participate, you may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
</p>
