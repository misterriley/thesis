<div align="center"><h2>Debriefing Statement</h2></div>
Thank you for your participation in this research on the preferred difficulty level of computer based tasks.  Novel computer-based tasks were used for all participants in this study.  The goal of the study was two-fold: to gather information on computer-user's preferred task difficulty, and to attempt to validate an algorithm which predicts outcome percentage.  It was hypothesized that participants would all prefer approximately the same percentage of correct trials for a task, and that each would set difficulty levels in such a way as to achieve this percentage correct. 
<p>
Current research has found that participants prefer a moderate level of difficulty for tasks.  Your participation was important in helping researchers find that level of difficulty and predict the optimal level for future tasks.

Final results will be available from the investigator, Steven Riley, by 2/13/2015.  You may contact me at <a href="mailto:NDNUVideoGameStudy@gmail.com">NDNUVideoGameStudy@gmail.com</a> to receive an email copy of the final report.  All results will be grouped together; therefore individual results are not available.  Your participation, including your name and answers, will remain absolutely confidential, even if the report is published.
